Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Patrick aka ðŸ”¥ Lizard. I am a 22y Biomimicry student from Germany. I am interested in game, tool and engine development and have been working and messing around with game dev for over 4 years now. I also have prior (professional) knowledge in Python. Nowadays I work with GodotEngine on several open-source projects such as Godot itself, GDExtension and several VFX and Shader projects.

Some of the projects I've been involved in are:

* [GodotVisualShader-Extras Addon - A Visual Shader Node Library for the Godot Engine](https://github.com/paddy-exe/GodotVisualShader-Extras)
* [Shader-Function-Extras - An library of helpful functions for Godot 4.0 to use in custom written shaders](https://github.com/paddy-exe/ShaderFunction-Extras)
* [Stylized Sky Shader - A showcase of the new SkyShader system in Godot 4.0 with clouds, stars, a moon and a sun](https://github.com/paddy-exe/GodotStylizedSkyShader)
* [Stylized Water Shader - My first take on a water shader based on depth-fading](https://github.com/paddy-exe/Godot-3D-Stylized-Water)
* [GDExtension Summator - A GDExtension Github template to quickly get started GDExtensions for 4.0](https://github.com/paddy-exe/GDExtensionSummator)
