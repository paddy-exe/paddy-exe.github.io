&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x1f4dd; The changed Godot icon was made by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/YuriSizov/godot-emotes/blob/master/LICENSE&#34;&gt;Yuri Sizov (CC-BY 4.0)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have ever wondered how (some) new features are getting added to each new iteration of the Godot Engine, you&amp;rsquo;ve come to the right place! In this post I will explain how you can add Visual Shader Nodes to the core engine &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/64248&#34;&gt;as I have&lt;/a&gt; and get a little insight of the Godot source code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Patrick aka ðŸ”¥ Lizard. I am a Biomimicry student from Germany.
I am interested in game, tool and engine development and have been working and messing around with game dev for a while.
I also have prior professional knowledge in Python. Nowadays, I work with the Godot Game Engine on several open-source
projects such as Godot itself, GDExtension and several VFX and Shader projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GDExtension - How to Write Your First Extension</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Godot 4.0 on the horizon a lot of people want to try out the new technologies that are coming with the new version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these is the GDExtension system that will be replacing the older GDNative system. GDNative was introduced as a means to enhance the editor itself by embedding C++ libraries or new language bindings into Godot. This had the advantage that users wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to build the engine themselves but import a dynamic library. The other way would be to write a custom module for Godot and compile it yourself. Both of these had their own disadvantages. GDNative doesn&amp;rsquo;t have full access to the C++ engine API as modules do. On the other side, modules need to be compiled on the target computer or you need to have a CI/CD solution like GitHub Actions to compile the editor (like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Gramps/GodotSteam&#34;&gt;GodotSteam&lt;/a&gt; does).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Godot Engine is nowadays one of most popular game engines (next to Unreal Engine and Unity) and that while being open-source and free to use without any royalties. There are LOTS of people contributing to the engine and I am very happy that I can now count myself to them. In this blog post, I want to explain how I got started contributing to Godot after being in awe for quite a while. I hope you can learn a bit from my experience and take something useful away here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
