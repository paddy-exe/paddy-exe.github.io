      <description>With Godot 4.0 on the horizon a lot of people want to try out the new technologies that are coming with the new version.

GDNative was introduced as a means to enhance the editor itself by embedding C++ libraries or new language bindings into Godot. This had the advantage that users wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to build the engine themselves but import a dynamic library.</description>
